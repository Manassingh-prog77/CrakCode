# CrakCode Chatbot

A chatbot application built using **LangChain**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, and the **Gemini** language model (LLM) for intelligent, context-aware, and human-like interactions. The chatbot leverages **Retrieve and Generate (RAG)** approach, allowing it to remember context and provide relevant answers to user queries based on a FAQ document, **CrakCode.txt**.

---

## Project Overview

The **CrakCode Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational agent designed to answer user questions regarding the **CrakCode organization**. The chatbot uses advanced NLP techniques such as embeddings and memory to understand and respond effectively to queries.

### Key Features:

- **Context-Aware Chatbot**: Utilizes the Retrieve and Generate (RAG) architecture to maintain the conversation context and provide accurate answers by retrieving relevant information from a FAQ document.
- **Embedding-Based Query Understanding**: The system is trained on **CrakCode.txt**, a document containing FAQs and general information about CrakCode, which is transformed into embeddings. These embeddings are used to search for contextually relevant data for each user query.
- **Memory of Past Conversations**: The chatbot remembers the context of previous conversations, allowing it to respond with a continuous, human-like flow. The conversation history is stored and used to maintain context throughout the interaction.
- **Bug and Feedback Classification**: The chatbot analyzes user queries to classify whether the input is related to a **bug report**, **feedback**, or **general FAQ**. This classification allows the chatbot to continue the conversation appropriately based on the nature of the user input.
- **Gemini LLM**: The language model used for generating human-like responses is **Gemini**, which ensures the chatbot can provide detailed and accurate answers.
- **Built with LangChain and Flask**: The backend is powered by **Flask** for handling API requests, while **LangChain** is used for handling the embedding and document loading for RAG-based retrieval.
- **Frontend with React**: The frontend is developed using **React** to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Project Architecture

- **Backend**: The backend is built with **Flask**, which exposes an API endpoint (`/chat`) to handle chat interactions. It integrates with LangChain to load the FAQ document, split it into chunks, generate embeddings, and use these embeddings for similarity-based context retrieval.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using **React** to display the chatbot interface, where users can interact with the system, send messages, and receive responses.
- **Memory**: The chatbot remembers the context of the conversation by storing chat history, allowing it to provide relevant and continuous interactions.
- **Embedding and Document Loading**: The **CrakCode.txt** document is loaded and processed, creating embeddings that enable efficient context retrieval for each user query.

---

## How It Works

1. **Loading Data**: The FAQ document **CrakCode.txt** is loaded and split into chunks, with embeddings generated for each chunk.
2. **Context Retrieval**: For each user query, the system retrieves contextually relevant information from the **vectorstore** (FAISS) based on the user input.
3. **Gemini LLM**: The relevant context is then passed to the **Gemini LLM**, which generates a response based on the provided context and chat history.
4. **Memory**: The chatbot maintains a conversation history, which is used to remember previous interactions and respond accordingly.
5. **Bug/Feedback Classification**: The system classifies the input as a bug report, feedback, or general FAQ, ensuring that the conversation flows in the appropriate direction.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used for building the backend API.
- **LangChain**: A framework used for document loading, chunk splitting, and integration with embeddings.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Used to generate vector representations of text data for efficient similarity search.
- **Gemini LLM**: The language model used for generating responses based on the provided context.
- **FAISS**: A library used to perform fast similarity search over the embeddings.
- **React**: The frontend framework used for building the interactive user interface.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the backend and NLP tasks.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
     ```

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Set the environment variable for the Gemini API key:
     ```bash
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # On Windows use 'set' instead of 'export'
     ```

3. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## API Endpoint

### **POST /chat**
This endpoint handles the user query and returns a response from the chatbot.

- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Your question or feedback here"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "response": "The chatbot's response to the user query",
    "category": "bug|feedback|general"
  }
  ```

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a database to store conversation history permanently.
- Expand the system to support more documents and FAQs.
- Add more advanced classification for different types of user queries (e.g., feature requests, complaints).
- Improve the chatbot's ability to handle more complex multi-turn conversations.
